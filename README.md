## Hi There 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!  I am a full-stack web developer working with the MERNG stack.  I am currently looking for work!  In my spare time I like to build React apps.

👯‍♀️ I'm looking to collaborate on Next JS & React JS

🤔 I'm looking for help with large scale backend projects

📫 How to reach me DominicktheDev@gmail.com

⚡️ Fun fact I have 2 dogs and if I am not working on a project I am either at the gym or outside enjoying the sun!
