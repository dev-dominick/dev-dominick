## Hi there 👋

I’m Dominick — a senior full-stack engineer working primarily with React, Next.js, Node, and Postgres.

I focus on building production-ready systems: clean architecture, integrations, performance, and software that holds up over time. I’m currently available for contract work and open to the right full-time opportunity.

### What I work on
- Full-stack web applications
- APIs and integrations
- Technical architecture and system design
- Performance and reliability improvements

I share practical notes and code from real projects. If something here saves you time or helps you think more clearly, that’s a win.

If you’d like to talk or support the work:
